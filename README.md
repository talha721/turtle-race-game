# Turtle Race Game

A simple, fun Turtle graphics race game built with Python's `turtle` module.

This repository contains a small Python project that can be used as a learning exercise for beginners who want to practice working with the `turtle` module, event handling, and simple game logic.

## Features

- Two (or more) turtles racing across the screen
- Start/stop controls and a simple way to choose the winner
- Easy to extend: add obstacles, AI opponents, betting, or keyboard controls

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- The standard library (no external packages required)

Note: The `turtle` module is part of the Python standard library, but it requires a GUI environment. On headless servers or WSL without an X server, `turtle` will not open a window.

## How to run

1. Open a terminal in the project directory (this project's root contains `main.py`).
2. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

If `main.py` is still a placeholder, replace it with the game's script or run the provided game file.

## Controls

- The specific controls depend on the implementation in `main.py`.
- Typical implementations start the race either automatically or when you press a key (for example, the spacebar).

## Project structure

- `main.py` - project entry point (may currently be a placeholder)
- `README.md` - this file

## Development & Extension ideas

- Implement the turtle race using the `turtle` module: create multiple `Turtle` objects, move them forward by random steps inside a game loop, and determine the winner when one crosses the finish line.
- Add a GUI panel or simple text input to let the user pick a turtle to bet on.
- Add obstacles or power-ups that affect turtle speed.
- Add a scoreboard and persistence (save high scores to a JSON file).
- Add unit tests for helper functions (random-seedable movement to test deterministic outcomes).

## Troubleshooting

- If nothing happens when you run the script, ensure you are running Python on a machine with a graphical environment (Windows, macOS, or a proper X server on Linux).
- If `turtle` raises an exception about display, try running the script locally (not via remote headless environments).

If you'd like, I can:
- Replace the placeholder `main.py` with a working turtle race implementation, or
- Add screenshots / animated GIFs and a short walkthrough in the README.

Tell me which you'd prefer and I'll proceed.
